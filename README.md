This project leverages Python to interact with external APIs, such as the OpenAI API (up to spring 2024) and Crisp APIs, a CRM system that facilitates real-time communication and updates. For a complete and secure interface, the project can be deployed using Candy Server.

Designed specifically for e-commerce stores, this project aims to enhance customer service with a virtual agent. It employs Flask along with various dependencies. To ensure that stores can quickly monitor the latest changes, the Crisp RTM API is utilized for real-time tracking and updates.
